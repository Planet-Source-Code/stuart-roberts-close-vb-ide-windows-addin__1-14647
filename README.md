## Close VB IDE Windows Addin


</div>

### Description

DLL which starts-up with VB and is inserted in the Add-In menu. When run it will close all Open Code and Designer windows from the screen (they are only closed from view, not removed from your project). Quite handy if you like all your windows shut before saving which will speed the time it takes to re-load your project next time around. Modify it to do what you like - this should get you started.
